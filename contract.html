      <h2>Contract</h2>
      <p>
        I, <a href="introduction.html">Jordan A. Perez</a>, agree to abide by
        the terms in my FA25 WEB115-N801 Web Markup and Scripting course with my
        instructor, Prof. D.I. von Briesen.
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites
        will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information
        there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep
        private.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not
        logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments
        may show as absences.
      </p>
